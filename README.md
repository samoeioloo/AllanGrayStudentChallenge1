# Allan Gray Student Challenge 1

This is my submission to the Allan Gray Student Challenge released on the 30th of April 2021.

# AG Number Scramble
The purpose of this little game is to put the numbers that are displayed, in the right order. In the game, set of eight squares will be displayed, where you as a player need to solve it by moving the tiles around and placing them in the correct order.
